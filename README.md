# Dynamic Color Palette

## Overview
I created this Dynamic Color Palette as a web application that provides users with a visually appealing and interactive way to explore and copy color values. It presents a collection of color cards organised into three categories: Warm Colors, Cool Colors, and Neutral Colors. Each color card displays the color name, HEX code, RGB code, and a "Copy to Clipboard" button. When a user clicks on the "Copy to Clipboard" button, the corresponding HEX code is copied to their clipboard, making it easy to use the color in their projects.

## Features
* Responsive design: The application is optimised for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
* Interactive card expansion: Clicking on a color card expands it to provide a larger view, while simultaneously shrinking the other cards for a dynamic effect.
* Copy to Clipboard functionality: The "Copy to Clipboard" button allows users to quickly copy the HEX code of a color to their clipboard, enabling easy integration into their projects.
* Color categorization: Colors are grouped into three categories (Warm Colors, Cool Colors, and Neutral Colors), providing organization and easy access to different color palettes.

## Use
